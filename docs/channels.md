# Channels

The heart and soul of the CabinTV platform are channels. Each channel belongs to a [Content Provider](content_provider.md). There for in order to add a channel you will first need to create a [Content Provider](content_provider.md).

**Requirements before creating a channel**
* At least one [Category](category.md)
* At least one [Content Provider](content_provider.md)

Each channel requires a number of parameters:
* <strong>Active</strong> (<i>Is the channel active or not</i>)
* <strong>Featured</strong> (<i>Is the channel featured or not</i>)
* <strong>Title</strong>
* <strong>Description</strong>
* <strong>Header</strong> (<i>Large hero image on desktop size: 1900x500 72dpi</i>)
* <strong>Header Mobile</strong> (<i>Appears on mobile only size: 1000x1200 72dpi</i>)
* <strong>Landscape Thumb</strong> (<i>Is the channel active or not size: 500x300 72dpi</i>)
* <strong>Portrait Thumb</strong> (<i>Is the channel active or not size: 500x900 72dpi</i>)

As of V1.0 we don't have a channel management system. Instead you need to add a channel via the [episode](episodes.md) creation process. To read more about adding a new channel [Click Here](add_channel.md)
