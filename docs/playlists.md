# Playlists

> Currently as of V1.0 we don't have a playlist management system. Instead you need to add a channel via the [episode](episodes.md) creation process. After selecting a channel you'll then be taken to the playlist management panel.

Playlists belong to channels therefore you need a channel first. Playlists are here to help your content providers organise there episodes. You can name a playlist anything you like ie: <strong>Season 1</strong>, <strong>Lifestyle Videos</strong>, <strong>How Tos</strong> etc.

**Requirements before creating a channel**
* At least one [Channel](channel.md)

Each playlist requires a number of parameters:
* <strong>Active</strong> (<i>Is the channel active or not</i>)
* <strong>Title</strong>
* <strong>Description</strong>

Adding a playlist is easy, simply click on the + icon in the top right hand corner. Alternativly if you want to add an episode to an already create playlist click "SELECT THIS PLAYLIST".
