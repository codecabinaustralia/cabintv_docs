# Add Channel

> Currently as of V1.0 we don't have a channel management system. Instead you need to add a channel via the [episode](episodes.md) creation process.

To add a new channel you will have to start by clicking "<strong>Manage Episodes</strong>" in the purple admin bar.

If all of your content providers have a channel attached to them already you can move on to [Episode](episodes.md) or [Playlist](playlists.md) Management by selecting the channel (<i>as seen in the yellow box below</i>). However, if you have any new Content Providers who have not yet had a channel attached to them you will be given an alternative option (<i>Hightlighted below in pink</i>). Here you can create a new channel and attach it to your content providers.

> NOTE: Editing channels will be launched in V1.1.
